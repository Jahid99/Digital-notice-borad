In an institution or organization, rapid information spreading is very important. Using of wall Notice Board in every place is a tedious work since it needs to be updated vigorously and with correct and right information manually. A Digital Notice Board System (DNB) is presented here to reduce the delaying time of the information to spread across the institution or organization as well as managing the right information only to being displayed on the notice board. DNB will help the students to get the updates and know what is going on within the environment wherever they are in due time. The prime objective of our system is to create a fully, fledged application which will send the notifications of events happening in and around the institution or organization so that no one will miss out being notified of interesting events like education, courses, and all about university students such as conferences, workshops, placements, etc. These notices can have text, images or include any kind of attachment files. Users can browse events categorically from the various category like sports, department, cultural, etc. happening in the institute with a single tap. This project includes major activity entities:  add notices, add staff record, and add student record which is handled by Admin.  The Admin can add, delete, and update them simultaneously on the online system. These can then be viewed by the students. The system will primarily be web-based so as to facilitate easy access to all staff or students regardless of their location or the type of machine. This project will teach us the practical implementation of object-oriented programming. Moreover, this will also provide us first-hand experience in several important fields of a Computer Engineering like Web Development and Application Development. It will also help us to learn web development scripts like PHP, JavaScript, HTML, Ajax and CSS and DBMS like MySQL. Apart from these, we strongly believe going through this project will make us more competent for similar future tasks and enhance our technical and other abilities.
